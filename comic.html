  <div class="jist-image">
    <p id="jist">
      "Eclipse Shard: Brotherhood's Wrath"* is a sci-fi epic that blends themes of family, power, and redemption with thrilling batt<br>les, intricate character arcs, and a richly imagined universe.<br>
      In a galaxy scarred by war and ruled by the oppressive Dominion Empire, two brothers stand on opposing sides of destiny.<br>
      Kael, a resilient warrior haunted by the destruction of his homeworld, leads a ragtag crew of misfits on a quest to overthrow the empire.<br>
      Opposing him is his estranged brother, Karan, now a high-ranking enforcer of the Dominion who believes strength and order are the only path to survival.<br>
      The story begins with Kael uncovering the empire’s plans to harness the energy of the *Eclipse Shard, an ancient artifact capable of reshaping the universe.<br>
      Kael assembles a diverse crew: the loyal powerhouse **Ragnar, the brilliant tactician **Selene, and the enigmatic shard-bearer **Ishaya*, whose power is both a blessing and a curse.<br>
      Together, they battle across treacherous worlds, face elite empire soldiers, and uncover the shard’s history while navigating themes of trust, sacrifice, and redemption.<br>
      As Kael and Karan’s paths converge, their ideological rift deepens into a battle of wills.<br>
      The climactic showdown on a dying starship tests Kael’s resolve to fight for unity and freedom against Karan’s belief in control and dominance.<br>
      The story culminates in an epic battle where Kael must decide whether to destroy the shard and his brother or risk the galaxy’s fate.<br>

<section id="character1">
  <div id="karanmain">
    <img src="fantasy.jpg" style="height: 300px;width: 250px;">
  <p id="karan">
    Karan is a character shrouded in dark allure and menace, a stark contrast to his brother Kael.<br>
    Standing tall and exuding an air of authority, his angular face is framed by jet-black hair slicked back to perfection, highlighting his sharp, chiseled features.<br>
    His piercing eyes, glowing faintly like embers, seem to see through the hearts of others, calculating every move and weakness with cold precision.<br>
    His attire further amplifies his intimidating presence: ceremonial armor wrought in black metal, its edges sharp like blades.<br>
    Veins of ominous red light pulse through the armor, hinting at a dark power coursing within.<br>
    His cold, stoic expression rarely breaks, masking the storm of rage, resentment, and unyielding ambition that burns within him.<br>
    Karan's personality is as sharp as his appearance.<br>
    Ruthless and power-hungry, he embodies the philosophy of "survival of the fittest," justifying his actions with a distorted belief in destiny and strength.<br>
    He manipulates and schemes without remorse, seeing relationships and loyalty as mere tools for his ascent.<br>
    To him, Kael's ideals of compassion and justice are signs of weakness, fueling his disdain.<br>
    Yet beneath this animosity lies a deep resentment—a shadow of what might have been a bond between brothers, now poisoned by envy and divergent paths.<br>
    As the story's antagonist, Karan is the embodiment of Kael’s greatest challenges—both external and internal.<br>
    His role extends beyond mere opposition; he is a reflection of the choices Kael must confront, a force that tests the strength of his resolve and the purity of his ideals.

  <div id="kaelmain">
    <img src="fantasy.jpg" style="height: 300px;width: 250px;">
  <p id="kael">
    Kael stands as a symbol of resilience and determination, a tall, lean warrior in his early 30s.<br>
    His dark, perpetually disheveled hair reflects a life spent on the battlefield, while his piercing green eyes burn with an unshakable sense of purpose.<br>
    His face and arms bear the scars of countless conflicts, each one a testament to his sacrifices and unwavering commitment to his cause.<br>
    He dons advanced armor that is both functional and sleek, its metallic accents enhancing his agility and amplifying his combat abilities.<br>
    At his side rests a glowing energy sword, a weapon that embodies his resolve and serves as a constant reminder of the battles he has fought and those yet to come.<br>
    Kael’s personality is a compelling mix of strength and compassion.<br>
    He is brave, fiercely loyal to his crew, and relentless in his pursuit of justice, making him an inspiring leader who others willingly follow.<br>
    Despite the pain and losses he has endured, Kael remains steadfast in his belief that the galaxy can be a better place.<br>
    His compassionate nature sets him apart, as he balances the harsh realities of conflict with a deep empathy for those he seeks to protect.<br>
    Kael's journey is one of struggle and redemption.<br>
    As the central figure in the story, he leads his crew with unwavering resolve, pushing forward even when the odds seem insurmountable.<br>
    His mission to overthrow the empire is not just a fight for freedom but also a deeply personal quest, as it ultimately leads him to confront his estranged brother, Karan.
    The clash between the two brothers, fueled by opposing ideologies and a shared history, becomes the emotional and dramatic core of the story, with Kael embodying hope and resilience in the face of darkness.
