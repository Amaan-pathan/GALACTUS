  <div class="jist-image">
    <p id="jist">
      Eclipse Shard: Brotherhood's Wrath is a sci-fi epic weaving themes of family, power, and<br>
      redemption with thrilling battles and intricate character arcs.<br>
      <br>
      In a galaxy scarred by war and ruled by the oppressive Dominion Empire, two estranged brothers<br>
      find themselves on opposing sides.<br>

      Kael, a resilient warrior, leads a crew of misfits to overthrow the empire, while his brother Karan, a<br>
      high-ranking enforcer, believes strength and order are the galaxy’s only salvation.<br>
      <br>
      Kael uncovers the Dominion’s plan to wield the Eclipse Shard, an artifact capable of reshaping the universe.<br>
      He assembles a team: the powerhouse Ragnar, the tactician Selene, and the enigmatic shard-bearer<br>
      Ishaya, whose powers are both a gift and a curse.<br>
      Their journey spans perilous worlds, battles elite soldiers, and unearths the shard's mysterious<br>
      origins, exploring themes of trust, sacrifice, and redemption.<br>
      <br>
      As the brothers’ ideologies clash, their paths converge in a climactic showdown on a dying starship.<br>
      Kael must choose between destroying the shard—and his brother—or risking the galaxy’s future in an epic final battle.

<section id="character1">
  <div id="karanmain">
    <img src="fantasy.jpg" style="height: 300px;width: 250px;">
  <p id="karan">
    Karan is a figure of dark allure and menace, a striking contrast to his brother Kael.<br>
    Tall and authoritative, his angular face is framed by jet-black hair slicked back to perfection,<br>
    emphasizing his sharp, chiseled features.<br>
    Piercing, ember-like eyes seem to pierce through others, calculating every weakness with cold<br>
    precision.<br>
    <br>
    His ceremonial armor, forged from black metal with blade-like edges, pulses with ominous red<br>
    veins of light, hinting at a dark power within.<br>
    A stoic expression masks the storm of rage, resentment, and ambition that fuels his every action.<br>
    <br>
    Ruthless and power-hungry, Karan embodies "survival of the fittest," justifying his cruelty with a<br>
    distorted belief in destiny.<br>
    He manipulates without remorse, viewing relationships and loyalty as tools for his ascent.<br>
    Kael's ideals of compassion and justice are weaknesses in Karan's eyes, deepening the rift<br>
    between them.<br>
    <br>
    Yet, beneath his animosity lies a shadow of what could have been—a bond now poisoned by envy<br>
    and divergent paths.<br>
    As the antagonist, Karan is more than a foe; he mirrors Kael’s inner and outer struggles, testing the<br>
    strength of his resolve and ideals.<br>

  <div id="kaelmain">

  <p id="kael">
    Kael is a symbol of resilience and determination, a tall, lean warrior in his early 30s.<br>
    His dark, perpetually disheveled hair reflects a life of battle, while his piercing green eyes burn<br>
    with unwavering purpose.<br>
    Scars on his face and arms speak of countless conflicts, each a testament to his sacrifices and<br>
    commitment.<br>
    <br>
    He wears sleek, functional armor that enhances his agility and combat abilities.<br>
    At his side is a glowing energy sword, a symbol of his resolve and the battles he has fought.<br>
    <br>
    Kael’s personality blends strength and compassion.<br>
    He is brave, fiercely loyal to his crew, and relentless in his pursuit of justice, inspiring those around<br>
    him.<br>
    <br>
    Despite his pain and losses, Kael holds onto the belief that the galaxy can be a better place.<br>
    <br>
    His journey is one of struggle and redemption.<br>
    Leading his crew with steadfast resolve, he pushes forward against insurmountable odds.<br>
   fight to overthrow the empire is both a quest for freedom and a personal mission, culminating<br>
   in a confrontation with his estranged brother, Karan.<br>
    This clash, rooted in opposing ideologies and a shared history, forms the emotional core of the<br>
    story, with Kael embodying hope and resilience in the face of darkness.
